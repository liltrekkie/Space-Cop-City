# Space-Cop-City
This is a 7 days to die mod for A16

To install, go to your games or servers directory, then go into Data, then Config, then create a backup of the files in the config folder, just copy and paste them somewhere, after that, drag and drop these files and replace the ones in the config folder. 

What this mods does: 

This mod changes the zombie AI, to make them more likely to attack you, and not run in a circle, they also will swipe randomly when agro'd.
Increase zombie spawns in wandering hordes, screamer hordes, random zombies, and decreased their respawn time. 
Wolves and dogs have their attack reach reduced from 2 blocks to a block and a quarter. 
Zeds can now see you from 100 blocks/meters away. 
A hub city spawns a 0,0 (dependant of seed name, not all seeds will spawn a hub, preview the seed before commiting)
